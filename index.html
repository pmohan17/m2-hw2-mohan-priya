    <h1> About Me </h1>
    <p> I was born and raised in a small town in Florida called Spring Hill. In 2019, I moved to Detroit to work for an arts nonprofit called ArtOps. I do public relations and marketing for various arts nonprofits in the city. My job gives me the opportunity to meet interesting artists and attend incredible concerts and events. <a href="https://detroitchamberwinds.org/"> You can click here to learn about my main client: Detroit Chamber Winds & Strings </a></p>

    <h3>One Fun Thing I Did this Summer:</h3>
    <p> I recently visited family in India in August and had a great time in the city of Chennai, which is located in the southern part of the country, by the east coast. I visited the Shore Temple called Mahabalipurum (pictured below) which is estimated to have been built around 725 a.d. </p>
